# Problem Statement/Objective
By the year  2224  , Earth has become uninhabitable due to severe environmental 
degradation, resource depletion, and climate collapse. With no viable solutions left 
on Earth, humanity must look beyond its home planet for survival. In response, the 
Stellar Coalition  , a global alliance of nations, has launched the  Stellar Project  â€”a 
mission to identify exoplanets that could serve as a new home. While  hundreds of 
exoplanets  have been detected, not all possess the necessary conditions to sustain 
life. A systematic method is required to evaluate and rank these planets based on their 
habitability potential. This study aims to analyze and preprocess exoplanetary data, 
identify key planetary characteristics such as atmospheric retention and stability, and 
develop a  scientifically driven Habitability Index  (HI)  to assess and classify 
exoplanets based on their suitability for sustaining life. The goal is to provide 
structured insights that can guide future space exploration and decision-making.
